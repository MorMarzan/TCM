The process helps develop <1>clarity</1> about what is most important <1>for you</1> and the <1>determination</1> to make your life much better. Through the program, you will learn how to break habit patterns which work against you, and instead develop habits that <1>really</1> help you. It will also strengthen your ability to observe your life and the choices you make through a new lens.",
